# Welcome to the RealArcade Digital Games Archive!

This archive contains an important amount of games (but not all) that were released by the now defunct RealArcade (RealOne Arcade) service provider, one of the most influential game distributors during the golden age of the Web Games, right before the rise of the Mobile Gaming with the very first iPhone.

Here we are at your service, 24/7. Whenever you need it. No need to tune in 93.11FM ;)


### Status

This repository is not in sync neither with the official RealArcade Digital Games Archive nor the RealArcade Games Preservation Project (RGPP). The main utility of this repo is to host the client installers that are not allowed by Internet Archive per Terms of Use, specifically related to bundleware detections by its antivirus.

Bundleware is not the same as virus. Just note the presence of Google Toolbar installers. Those can't be removed unfortunately. The approach is to be as precise as possible with the files we provide to the public.

For updated gamelists, please visit https://archive.org/details/com.real.arcade


### About RGS installer files

RGS is RealNetworks' proprietary format for encapsulating Web Games. These files are only usable within RealArcade. These installers interact with RealArcade's catalog file before installing. If the RGS file is newer than the user's catalog file, it refuses to install until a newer version is downloaded. It's seen the very first beta version of RealArcade and the latest one, v1.4, ignore those checks. You can download a frozen Catalog file from this site. To install, replace your RealArcade Catalog folder with the ZIP archive.


### Instructions

First make sure you are installing the RealArcade games client. This archive recommends you to install v1.2.0.1256 for compatibility reasons. Once installed, download any RGS from this site and double-click on them. The game should install shortly. Unless said otherwise, all RGS are 60-minute demo files.


### Legal Agreements

Any legal agreement between the user and the game developer should still be respected. Always read the EULA before you do anything. We also encourage supporting the game publishers buying a copy if possible from current web game stores.
